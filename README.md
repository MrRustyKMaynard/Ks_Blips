Simple blip Creator for FiveM

My first ever script! Made this to try get into Lua language while working on fivem servers

Standalone Resource but only tested with latest Qb-Core

Simple drag/drop into your resources folder & add ensure/start Ks_Blips

All edits are made in the config.lua file & create as many as you wish
